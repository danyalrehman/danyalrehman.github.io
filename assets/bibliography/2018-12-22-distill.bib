	abstract     = {Clay pot coolers are low-cost technologies that can prolong vegetable shelf-life by providing a cool and humid storage environment through evaporative cooling. A predictive performance model of these systems is not available for investigating the impact of design modifications on device performance. This study proposes transport models for pot-in-pot and pot-in-dish coolers that have been validated with experimental data from 17 field trials from Mali and Rwanda with maximum errors of less than 6% observed. Results show that the pot-in-pot and pot-in-dish devices consume 1.96 and 2.85 L/day of water, respectively. A parametric study was conducted to evaluate how the refrigeration efficiency and daily water consumption are affected by the size of the device, local wind speed, and the mass of vegetables stored in the cooler. Increasing local wind speeds provides a net positive impact on refrigeration efficiency despite the increased convective heating. In addition, the quantity of vegetable mass showed a negligible impact on daily water consumption. Insights from the model suggest that water consumption is more efficient for larger devices.}

	abstract     = {To decarbonize our global energy system, sustainably harvesting metals from diverse sourcewaters is essential. Membrane-based processes have recently shown great promise in meeting these needs by achieving high metal ion selectivities with relatively low water and energy use. An example is nanofiltration, which harnesses steric, dielectric, and Donnan exclusion mechanisms to perform size- and charge-based fractionation of metal ions. To further optimize nanofiltration systems, multicomponent models are needed; however, conventional methods necessitate large amounts of data for model calibration, introduce substantial uncertainty into the characterization process, and often yield poor results when extrapolated. In this work, we develop a new computational architecture to alleviate these concerns. Specifically, we develop a framework that: (1) reduces the data requirement for model calibration to only charged species measurements; (2) eliminates uncertainty propagation problems present in conventional characterization processes; (3) enables exploration of pH optimization for enhancing metal ion selectivities; and (4) enables uncertainty quantification to assess the sensitivity of partition coefficients and ion driving forces to learned pore size distributions. Our framework captures eight independent datasets comprising over 500 measurements to within ±15%. Our studies also suggest that the expectation–maximization algorithm can effectively learn pore size distributions and that optimizing pH can improve metal ion selectivities by a factor of 3–10×. Our findings also reveal that image charges appear to play a less pronounced role in dielectric exclusion under the studied conditions and that ion driving forces are more sensitive to pore size distributions than partition coefficients.}

	abstract     = {One of the most well-established frameworks for modeling multicomponent transport in nanofiltration (NF) is the Donnan-Steric Pore Model with Dielectric Exclusion (DSPM-DE). Conventional DSPM-DE characterizes transport across NF membranes through four governing membrane parameters:\ (1) pore radius; (2) effective membrane thickness; (3) membrane charge density; and (4) the dielectric constant inside the membrane pores. The process for quantifying these parameters is typically sequential. First, neutral solute experiments are performed to determine pore radius and effective membrane thickness. Next, charged species experiments are conducted, and the data is used to regress out the remaining parameters. The resulting regressions are often performed using local search algorithms that can struggle to provide low residuals with robust fits. In addition, this two-step approach tends to:\ (1) require a substantial number of charged and uncharged solute experiments; and (2) introduce assumed relationships between pore size and water flux, such as the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, which may not be representative of transport through complex pore networks. To address these issues, we propose the use of metaheuristic global optimization techniques supplemented with gradient-free local search and maximum likelihood estimation to simultaneously regress all four membrane parameters directly from charged species experiments. We validate our approach against eight independent datasets across diverse input salinities, compositions, and membranes.}

This process can be beneficial when the divalent rich stream has potential applications. In agriculture, for example, a stream rich in calcium and magnesium is deemed beneficial for crops and can decrease the use of fertilizers that would otherwise need to be re-introduced to the source water prior to irrigation. MSED has been used for salt production, brine concentration, and irrigation. An experimentally validated computational model to predict its performance, however, is not available in the literature. The present work uses concepts from conventional ED modelling to build a high-resolution predictive model for the performance of MSED. The model was validated with over 32 experiments at different operating conditions and observed to fit the data to within 6% and 8% for two different types of membranes. All voltage predictions were within 10% of experiments conducted. The model was then used to predict permselectivity across different salinities and compositions. These values were extended to investigate the economic benefits of using MSED to save fertilizers for greenhouses across the U.S. Results showed an average of $4991 saved per hectare when employing MSED technology. These values aligned with predictions from two previous techno-economic studies conducted investigating MSED for agriculture.}

Currently, full computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are required to simulate wake effects over complex terrains. Due to their high computational cost, it is difficult to apply expensive CFD simulations in the wind farm design process as optimization algorithms often require large number of solution evaluations. The proposed wake model solves a simplified variation of the Navier-Stokes equations, in which simplifications and assumptions have been implemented in order to reduce computational cost while maintaining accuracy. This model was validated by comparing with full CFD simulations with reasonable accuracy. In general, the model produces accurate results while keeping the computational cost two orders of magnitude lower than that of full CFD simulations. The low computation time highlights the model's potential to be used for optimizing wind farm layouts on complex terrains.}

However, conventional polyamide-based commercial NF membranes are ineffective in lithium recovery processes due to their undesired Li+/Mg2+ selectivity. In addition, they are constrained by the water permeance selectivity trade-off, which means that a highly permeable membrane often has lower selectivity. In this study, we developed a novel nonpolyamide NF membrane based on metal-coordinated structure, which exhibits simultaneously improved water permeance and Li+/Mg2+ selectivity. Specifically, the optimized Cu–m-phenylenediamine (MPD) membrane demonstrated a high water permeance of 16.2 ± 2.7 LMH/bar and a high Li+/Mg2+ selectivity of 8.0 ± 1.0, which surpassed the trade-off of permeance selectivity. Meanwhile, the existence of copper in the Cu–MPD membrane further enhanced anti-biofouling property and the metal-coordinated nanofiltration membrane possesses a pH-responsive property. Finally, a transport model based on the Nernst–Planck equations has been developed to fit the water flux and rejection of uncharged solutes to the experiments conducted. The model had a deviation below 2\% for all experiments performed and suggested an average pore radius of 1.25 nm with a porosity of 21\% for the Cu–MPD membrane. Overall, our study provides an exciting approach for fabricating a nonpolyamide high-performance nanofiltration membrane in the context of lithium recovery.}

In this paper, the linear van ’t Hoff approach is compared to the solutions using OLI Stream Analyzer, which gives the real osmotic pressure values. Various dilutions of NaCl solutions, including the lower solute concentrations typical of river water, are considered. Our results indicate that the disparity in the predicted osmotic pressure of the two considered methods can reach 30%, depending on the solute concentration, while that in the predicted power density can exceed over 50%. New experimental results are obtained for NanoH2O and Porifera membranes, and theoretical equations are also developed. Results show that discrepancies arise when using the van ’t Hoff equation, compared to the OLI method. At higher NaCl concentrations (C &gt; 1.5 M), the deviation between the linear approach and the real values increases gradually, likely indicative of a larger error in van ’t Hoff predictions. The difference in structural parameter values predicted by the two evaluation methods is also significant; it can exceed the typical 50–70% range, depending on the operating conditions. We find that the external mass transfer coefficients should be considered in the evaluation of the structural parameter in order to avoid overestimating its value. Consequently, measured water flux and predicted structural parameter values from our own and literature measurements are recalculated with the OLI software to account for external mass transfer coefficients.}

This paper evaluates whether Neosepta ion exchange membranes, originally manufactured to concentrate seawater for salt production, show sufficient monovalent selectivity in the brackish salinity range to be suitable for use in greenhouse agriculture. Using an MSED-R experimental set-up, 16 brackish groundwater compositions are tested to determine membrane parameters, including limiting current, membrane resistance, membrane permeability, and membrane selectivity. Across compositions, the Neosepta membranes show monovalent selectivity for sodium relative to calcium and magnesium and for chloride relative to sulfate. The membrane selectivities are used to calculate MSED-R fertilizer savings relative to RO for brackish groundwaters across the U.S. Regions in which brackish groundwaters contain greater than the target nutrient concentrations for crop growth, or show potential for MSED-R adoption, are also identified.}

Reverse osmosis removes both monovalent ions detrimental to crops (Na+,Cl−) and divalent ions beneficial for crops (Ca2+,Mg2+,SO42−). Fertilizer must then be added to the desalinated water to reintroduce these nutrients. Unlike reverse osmosis, monovalent selective electrodialysis selectively removes monovalent ions while retaining divalent ions in the desalinated water. This paper investigates the monovalent selectivity and cost effectiveness of the widely-used Neosepta and new Fujifilm monovalent selective electrodialysis membranes in treating seawater for irrigation. Membrane selectivity, limiting current, and resistance are experimentally characterized. These system parameters are inputs to the developed cost model, which determines fertilizer and water savings, as well as operating and capital costs, relative to reverse osmosis; the primary operating cost difference stems from reverse osmosis’s significantly lower energy consumption. Given prices of commercially available membranes, monovalent selective electrodialysis costs an average of 30% more than reverse osmosis. At the projected sales price of Fujifilm membranes, which are still under development, monovalent selective electrodialysis costs an average of 10% more than reverse osmosis; if electricity costs are less than 0.08 $/kWh, monovalent selective electrodialysis is on par with reverse osmosis. Regardless of membrane price and electricity cost, solar-powered desalination is only economical if photovoltaic capital costs are significantly reduced to 0.10–0.20 $/kWh. When monovalent selective electrodialysis exceeds reverse osmosis cost, the financial requirements for competitive monovalent selective electrodialysis (e.g., energy consumption, electricity cost, energy source, membrane cost) are evaluated.}

Sodium accumulation in wastewater is often considered the main bottleneck to achieving 100% reuse. Consequently, greenhouses have begun adopting reverse osmosis (RO), the most commonly used desalination technology for wastewater treatment. RO removes ions from wastewater indiscriminately, including multivalent nutrients to crops (Ca2+, Mg2+, SO42−, PO43−). In contrast, monovalent selective electrodialysis (MSED) selectively removes monovalent sodium while retaining multivalent nutrients in solution. For greenhouses that have not achieved MLD, MSED has an alternative application of reducing levels of nitrate, a monovalent ion and agricultural pollutant, in wastewater for disposal. This paper investigates the monovalent selectivity and potential of the widely-used Neosepta MSED membranes and the new Fujifilm MSED membranes to treat wastewater in greenhouses for reuse or discharge. Eight effluent compositions are tested as feedwater in a laboratory MSED system. Both membranes demonstrate selectivity towards sodium and nitrate across the tested compositions. Fujifilm cation-exchange membranes remove two to six sodium ions, compared to Neosepta's two to eight, for every magnesium ion. Fujifilm anion-exchange membranes remove two to seven nitrate ions, compared to Neosepta's two to six, for every sulfate ion.}

	abstract     = {Osmotically-assisted membrane processes (OAMP) are separation technologies that leverage osmotic gradients to recover water from brine. Accurate modeling of the solute-coupling effects for transmembrane transport is integral to the development and subsequent optimization of OAMP unit operations. In the literature, multicomponent transport in OAMP is commonly linearized, and species fluxes are computed using binary solution-diffusion theory and then superposed. However, recent publications highlight the large predictive errors associated with such an approach as the transport coupling between species is ignored. In this paper, we demonstrate that significant improvements in multicomponent species fluxes can be obtained when solute-coupling interactions are incorporated. Here, we present a multicomponent solution-diffusion model, by extending the binary solution-diffusion model with multicomponent diffusion theory. When multicomponent diffusion coefficients are available, we find that the average absolute deviation (AAD) of the model decreased from 21.0% to 3.0% for 7 unique combinations of forward osmosis processes involving ternary mixtures. In the absence of data for multicomponent diffusion coefficients, we demonstrate that the multicomponent model can regress the impact of transport coupling on water and solute fluxes, using excess solute permeabilities. For the case of H2O-NaCl-EtOH forward osmosis process, the AAD of the solution-diffusion model is shown to decrease from 66.1% to 7.2% for NaCl concentrations from 0.0 to 1.5 M and EtOH mass fractions from 0.0 to 0.5. These values are extended to analyze the implications on the thermodynamic and membrane area requirements of the desalination systems employing OAMP.}
