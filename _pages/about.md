I'm a Banting postdoctoral researcher at [Mila &ndash; Qu&eacute;bec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/) under [Yoshua Bengio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshua_Bengio) working on generative models for scientific discovery. I am also a visiting researcher at the [Broad Institute of MIT & Harvard](https://www.broadinstitute.org/) under [Jim Collins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_J._Collins) developing deep learning models for molecular discovery. 

Previously, I completed a joint Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering and Computational Science & Engineering from the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)](https://www.mit.edu/). During that time, I was awarded fellowships from the Martin Family Society of Fellows for Sustainability and the Abdul Latif Jameel (J-WAFS) World Water and Food Systems Lab. Prior to that, I completed my undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering with High Honours from the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/). 

My Ph.D. research focused on the development of physics-informed deep learning methods and accelerated partial differential equations (PDEs) solvers for diverse physics-based applications. Examples include developing attention-enhanced neural differential equations models for ion transport phenomena (under [John H. Lienhard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_H._Lienhard_V)) and self-supervised learning (SSL) methods with Lie point symmetries for partial differential equations (under [Yann LeCun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yann_LeCun)). More recently, my interests have extended to combining deep generative models with physics-based priors for the natural sciences, with a particular focus on scientific discovery and out-of-distribution generalization.

In my spare time, I enjoy watching/playing football (long-term supporter of [Arsenal F.C.](https://www.arsenal.com/)), running, and bouldering (both indoors and outdoors).
