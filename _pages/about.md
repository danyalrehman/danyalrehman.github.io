I'm an incoming postdoctoral associate at the Montr&eacute;al Institute for Learning Algorithms ([Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/)) under [Yoshua Bengio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshua_Bengio) working on deep generative models for scientific discovery. I am currently a visiting researcher at the [Broad Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org/) (under [Jim Collins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_J._Collins)) developing ML models for antibiotic discovery. 

Previously, I completed a joint Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering and Computational Science & Engineering at the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)](https://www.mit.edu/). During that time, I was awarded fellowships from the Martin Family Society of Fellows for Sustainability and the Abdul Latif Jameel World Water and Food Systems Lab. Prior to that, I completed my undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering with High Honours at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/). 

My Ph.D. research centered around the development of physics-informed deep learning methods and accelerated partial differential equations (PDEs) solvers for diverse physics-based applications. Examples include developing attention-enhanced neural differential equations models for ion transport phenomena (under [John H. Lienhard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_H._Lienhard_V)) and self-supervised learning (SSL) methods with Lie point symmetries for partial differential equations (under [Yann LeCun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yann_LeCun)). More recently, my interests have extended to combining deep generative models with physics-based priors for the natural sciences, with a particular focus on scientific discovery and out-of-distribution generalization.

In my spare time, I enjoy watching/playing football (long-term supporter of [Arsenal F.C.](https://www.arsenal.com/)) and bouldering/rock climbing both indoors and outdoors.
